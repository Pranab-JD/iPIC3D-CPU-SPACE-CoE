# iPIC3D

## Requirements
  - gcc/g++ compiler
  - cmake (minimum version 2.8)
  - MPI (OpenMPI or MPICH)
  - HDF5 (optional)
  - Paraview/Catalyst (optional)

## Installation
1. Download the code
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/Pranab-JD/iPIC3D-CPU-SPACE-CoE.git
```

2. Create build directory
``` shell
cd iPIC3D-CPU-SPACE-CoE && mkdir build && cd build
```

3. Compile the code
``` shell
cmake ..
make -j     # -j = build with max # of threads - fast, recommended
```

4. Run
``` shell
# no_of_proc = XLEN x YLEN x ZLEN (as specified in the input file)
mpirun -np no_of_proc ./iPIC3D  inputfilename.inp
```

**Important:** make sure `number of MPI process = XLEN x YLEN x ZLEN` as specified in the input file.

On a supercomputer or a cluster (especially a multinode system), you should use `srun` to launch iPIC3D.

This version of iPIC3D (with the implicit moment method (IMM)) has been developed by Prof Stefano Markidis and his team. The energy conserving semi-implicit method (ECSIM) and Relativistic semi-implicit method (RelSIM) has been implemented by Dr Pranab J Deka and Prof Fabio Bacchini.
